1. **Docker Image:**
   - A Docker image is a lightweight, stand-alone, and executable package that contains everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files.
   - Images are often built from a set of instructions defined in a Dockerfile. These instructions specify how to assemble the image layer by layer.
   - Docker images are typically stored in a registry, such as Docker Hub or a private registry, and can be versioned.
   - Images are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once created. To make changes, you create a new image with the necessary modifications.

2. **Docker Container:**
   - A Docker container is an instance of a Docker image that is running as a process on your host system. It is a runnable instance of an image.
   - Containers are isolated from the host and other containers, providing consistency in different environments.
   - Containers are lightweight and can be started and stopped quickly. They encapsulate the application and its dependencies, ensuring consistent behavior across different environments.
   - Containers can be created, started, stopped, deleted, and managed using containerization platforms like Docker or Kubernetes.

In summary, an image is a static, read-only blueprint that defines what should be run, while a container is a running instance of that image with its own isolated environment. Containers are where your applications run, and you can run multiple containers from the same image simultaneously. Docker images provide portability and consistency for deploying applications across different environments, while containers offer the runtime environment for those applications.
