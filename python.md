In Python, `==`, `=`, and `is` are used for different purposes and have distinct meanings:

1. `==` (Equality Operator):
   - `==` is used to compare the **values** of two objects or variables to check if they are equal.
   - It returns `True` if the values are equal and `False` otherwise.
   - Example: `x == y` checks if the values stored in variables `x` and `y` are the same.

2. `=` (Assignment Operator):
   - `=` is used for **assignment** in Python.
   - It assigns a value to a variable.
   - Example: `x = 10` assigns the value `10` to the variable `x`.

3. `is` (Identity Operator):
   - `is` is used to check if two objects or variables refer to the **same memory location** (identity).
   - It returns `True` if the objects are the same (refer to the same memory location) and `False` otherwise.
   - Example: `x is y` checks if `x` and `y` reference the same object in memory.

In summary:

- `==` checks if the values of two objects are equal.
- `=` is used for variable assignment.
- `is` checks if two objects have the same identity (i.e., refer to the same memory location).
