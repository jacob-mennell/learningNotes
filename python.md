**Python Operators:**

In Python, `==`, `=`, and `is` are used for different purposes and have distinct meanings:

1. `==` (Equality Operator):
   - `==` is used to compare the **values** of two objects or variables to check if they are equal.
   - It returns `True` if the values are equal and `False` otherwise.
   - Example: `x == y` checks if the values stored in variables `x` and `y` are the same.

2. `=` (Assignment Operator):
   - `=` is used for **assignment** in Python.
   - It assigns a value to a variable.
   - Example: `x = 10` assigns the value `10` to the variable `x`.

3. `is` (Identity Operator):
   - `is` is used to check if two objects or variables refer to the **same memory location** (identity).
   - It returns `True` if the objects are the same (refer to the same memory location) and `False` otherwise.
   - Example: `x is y` checks if `x` and `y` reference the same object in memory.

In summary:

- `==` checks if the values of two objects are equal.
- `=` is used for variable assignment.
- `is` checks if two objects have the same identity (i.e., refer to the same memory location).

**Abstract Methods:**

# Abstraction Example: Shape Drawing

## Abstract Class: Shape

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def draw(self):
        pass
```

The abstract class `Shape` defines a common interface with an abstract method `draw`. This serves as a blueprint for various shapes, ensuring they all implement the `draw` method.

## Concrete Classes: Circle, Square, Triangle

```python
class Circle(Shape):
    def draw(self):
        return "Drawing a Circle"

class Square(Shape):
    def draw(self):
        return "Drawing a Square"

class Triangle(Shape):
    def draw(self):
        return "Drawing a Triangle"
```

Concrete classes like `Circle`, `Square`, and `Triangle` inherit from the abstract class `Shape` and provide specific implementations of the `draw` method.

## Usage: Drawing Shapes

```python
def draw_shape(shape):
    return shape.draw()

circle = Circle()
square = Square()
triangle = Triangle()

print(draw_shape(circle))    # Output: Drawing a Circle
print(draw_shape(square))    # Output: Drawing a Square
print(draw_shape(triangle))  # Output: Drawing a Triangle
```

The `draw_shape` function takes any object that conforms to the `Shape` interface, allowing you to draw different shapes without worrying about their specific implementations.

### Notes on Abstraction:

- **Encapsulation of Interface:** Abstract classes encapsulate a common interface, promoting a consistent structure across derived classes.

- **Code Flexibility:** Abstraction allows you to write functions or systems that can work with any class adhering to a specific interface, providing flexibility in code usage.

- **Promotes Modularity:** By hiding implementation details, abstraction encourages modularity and separation of concerns, making the codebase more maintainable.

- **Blueprint for Subclasses:** Abstract classes act as blueprints, guiding the implementation of concrete subclasses while ensuring adherence to a predefined structure.
