**Virtual Network (VNET)**
A Virtual Network (VNet) is a representation of your own network in the cloud. It is a logical isolation of the Azure cloud dedicated to your subscription.

###Sub-Net
A Subnet is a range within the VNet. You can divide a VNet into multiple subnets for organization and security.

###Example
Imagine a city as a whole to be a VNet. This city has various districts, and these districts can be considered as Subnets. The entire city (VNet) has a boundary, and within this boundary, there are several districts (Subnets). Each district (Subnet) has its own rules, regulations, and characteristics, but they all fall under the jurisdiction of the city (VNet).

In terms of Azure:

A VNet (Virtual Network) in Azure is a network that you can define in Azure. It is your private network in the cloud. You can configure its IP address range, create subnets, route tables, private DNS zones, etc.

A Subnet is a range within that VNet that you can designate for specific resources. It allows you to segment the network, and improve security and traffic management.

###Firewall Rules
Firewall rules are crucial for maintaining the security of your network. In this context, inbound and outbound rules need to be enabled on the server that you want to access. Inbound rules control the incoming traffic to the server, while outbound rules control the outgoing traffic from the server. These rules can be configured to allow traffic only from trusted sources, thus enhancing the security of your data.

Example of a VNET with a specific subnet for a virtual machine:
VNET IP Range: A VNet might have an IP address range of "10.0.0.0/16", which means the VNet has a total address space of 2^16 (65,536) IP addresses.

Subnet for Virtual Machine: Within this VNet, you can create a Subnet with an IP address range of "10.0.1.0/24" for your virtual machine.

Host Addresses in the Subnet: With "/24," there are 2^8 (32-24) (256) possible host addresses within the subnet. However, two addresses are reserved: one for the network address (10.0.1.0) and one for the broadcast address (10.0.1.255). So, the usable host addresses for devices within this subnet range from 10.0.1.1 to 10.0.1.254.

In summary, a subnet "10.0.1.0/24" has been created within a VNet "10.0.0.0/16," providing a range of 254 usable IP addresses for devices or virtual machines within that subnet.
