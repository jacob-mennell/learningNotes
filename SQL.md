# SQL 

**Union vs. Union All**:
- **Union**: The `UNION` operator in SQL combines the result sets of two or more SELECT statements into a single result set, removing duplicates. It returns a distinct set of rows.
- **Union All**: The `UNION ALL` operator also combines result sets but doesn't remove duplicates. It includes all rows from each SELECT statement, which can be more efficient than `UNION` when duplicates are not a concern.

**Transaction**:
- A transaction in SQL is a group of one or more SQL statements executed together as a single unit. Transactions are used to ensure data consistency and integrity.
- Transactions can be committed (saved) or rolled back (undone) as a whole. If any part of a transaction fails, the entire transaction can be rolled back to maintain data integrity.

**Stored Procedure vs. Function**:
- **Stored Procedure**: A stored procedure is a set of precompiled SQL statements that can be executed on demand. It can perform actions and may not necessarily return a value. Stored procedures are typically used for performing tasks or actions within the database.
- **Function**: A function is a precompiled SQL statement that returns a single value or a table of values. It is designed to be used in SQL queries and can be called within SQL statements to compute and return values.

**Merge (MERGE statement)**:
- The `MERGE` statement in SQL is used to perform conditional INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations on a target table based on a source table or query. It is often used for synchronizing data between two tables.

**Offset and Limit**:
- In SQL, `OFFSET` and `LIMIT` are used for pagination. `OFFSET` specifies the number of rows to skip from the beginning of the result set, and `LIMIT` restricts the number of rows returned.
- For example, `SELECT * FROM table_name OFFSET 5 LIMIT 10` retrieves rows 6 to 15 from the `table_name`.

**Star vs. Snowflake Schema**:
- **Star Schema**: In data warehousing, a star schema is a design where a central fact table is connected to dimension tables. It's called a "star" because the diagram resembles a star, with the fact table in the center and dimension tables surrounding it.
- **Snowflake Schema**: A snowflake schema is a variation of the star schema where dimension tables are normalized into multiple related tables. This normalization can reduce data redundancy but may require more complex queries.

**Try-Catch in SQL**:
- `TRY...CATCH` is an error-handling mechanism in SQL. It allows you to try a block of code and, if an error occurs, catch and handle it gracefully.
- If an error occurs within the `TRY` block, control is passed to the `CATCH` block, where you can log the error, perform cleanup, or take other appropriate actions.
- Using `TRY...CATCH` helps prevent unhandled exceptions from crashing your SQL code and provides better error reporting and handling.

## Partition, distribution, index 

**Partitioning**:
- **Definition**: Partitioning involves dividing a large table into smaller, manageable pieces called partitions based on a chosen column or key, such as date or region.
- **Purpose**: It improves query performance, data manageability, and maintenance.
- **Example**: Partitioning by date or region can significantly enhance query efficiency for specific date ranges or regions.
- **Parallelism**: When querying a single partition, parallel compute benefits may be limited since most nodes remain idle.
- **Data Transfer Overhead**: Querying a single partition may still introduce some data transfer overhead if the data spans multiple nodes.
- **Balancing Act**: Designing an effective partitioning strategy involves balancing optimization for specific queries with the overall data distribution strategy.

**Distribution**:
- **Definition**: Distribution determines how data is physically spread across multiple nodes or servers in a distributed database system.
- **Purpose**: It achieves data scalability, fault tolerance, and parallel processing in a distributed environment.
- **Types**: Common distribution types include hash distribution (evenly distributes data based on a hash of a column's value), range distribution (distributes data based on a defined range of values), and round-robin distribution (evenly distributes data without considering the data itself).
- **Example**: Hash distribution can optimize query performance when targeting specific data subsets.
- **Parallel Computing**: Distribution maximizes parallel computing benefits when queries involve broader data ranges or multiple data subsets.

**Indexes** (Clustered vs. Non-Clustered):
- **Clustered Index**: Defines the physical order of data rows in a table based on the index key. There can only be one clustered index per table.
  - Ideal for speeding up queries that involve range scans or retrieve data in the order of the index.
  - The actual data rows are stored in the same order as the clustered index, reducing data retrieval times.
- **Non-Clustered Index**: Creates a separate structure for index data that references the actual data rows in the table.
  - Suitable for speeding up queries that involve data retrieval by specific column values, but not necessarily in a specific order.
  - Offers flexibility for multiple non-clustered indexes on a single table.

In summary, partitioning enhances query performance and data manageability by dividing tables into smaller pieces, while distribution optimizes parallel computing in a distributed database. Indexes, whether clustered or non-clustered, play a critical role in improving query performance by providing efficient access paths to the data. Balancing these strategies based on your specific use case is essential for efficient database design.

In SQL databases, you would use both clustered and non-clustered indexes, but they serve different purposes and are applied in different scenarios:

**Clustered Index**:
1. **Primary Key**: A clustered index determines the physical order of data rows in a table. Typically, a table has only one clustered index, and it's often defined on the primary key column(s).
2. **Data Organization**: Data rows in a table with a clustered index are physically stored in the same order as the index. This means that the clustered index defines the table's physical structure.
3. **Data Retrieval**: Clustered indexes are efficient for retrieving ranges of data or sorting data because the data is physically ordered as per the index.
4. **Unique**: By default, a primary key constraint creates a unique clustered index. It enforces data integrity by ensuring that each row is uniquely identifiable.

**Non-Clustered Index**:
1. **Additional Indexes**: You can have multiple non-clustered indexes on a table. These are used to improve query performance for specific columns or queries.
2. **Data Organization**: Non-clustered indexes store a copy of the indexed column(s) with a pointer to the corresponding data row in the clustered index or the heap (if there's no clustered index). So the non clustered index points to the right rowe in clustered index. Additional helper.
3. **Data Retrieval**: Non-clustered indexes are useful for efficiently querying specific columns or for sorting data based on the indexed columns. They can significantly improve query performance for filtering operations.
4. **Not Unique**: Non-clustered indexes do not have to be unique. Multiple rows can have the same indexed values.

**When to Use Each**:
- **Clustered Index**: Use a clustered index when you want to determine the physical order of data rows in a table, such as when defining a primary key. Typically, choose a column that is frequently used in range queries or sorting operations.
- **Non-Clustered Index**: Use non-clustered indexes to improve query performance for specific columns or to create indexes on columns that are not suitable for a clustered index. They are especially useful for columns frequently used in filtering or joining operations.

In summary, clustered indexes define the physical order of data in a table and are suitable for columns used in sorting and range queries, while non-clustered indexes are used to improve query performance for specific columns and are handy for columns used in filtering and joining operations. The choice between them depends on your specific querying and data retrieval needs.

A heap, which is a database table without a clustered index (meaning the rows are stored in no specific order), can have different performance characteristics compared to a table with a clustered index. Whether a heap is quicker or slower to query depends on the specific context and the types of queries you are performing. Here are some considerations:

**Advantages of a Heap (No Clustered Index):**
1. **Insert Performance**: Inserts into a heap can be faster because there's no need to maintain the physical order of data rows.
2. **Simplified Maintenance**: Heap tables can be easier to maintain for certain scenarios, especially when there are frequent data inserts and updates. There's no need to rearrange data rows as in a clustered index.

**Disadvantages of a Heap:**
1. **Slower Retrieval**: Retrieving data from a heap can be slower for certain types of queries, especially those involving filtering, sorting, or joining, because there is no specific order to the data rows.
2. **Fragmentation**: Over time, as data is inserted, updated, and deleted, a heap can become fragmented. Fragmentation can negatively impact query performance.
3. **Full Table Scans**: Queries that do not use an index often require full table scans in a heap, which can be slower than indexed retrieval.

**Clustered Index Advantages:**
1. **Faster Retrieval**: A clustered index provides a specific order to the data rows, making it faster for range queries, sorting, and retrieval based on the indexed columns.
2. **Reduced Fragmentation**: Because a clustered index organizes data, it can reduce fragmentation and maintain data continuity.
3. **Better for Joins**: Clustered indexes can improve join performance when joining on the indexed columns.

In summary, the choice between a heap and a clustered index depends on your specific use case. If your workload primarily involves data inserts and updates with few read operations, a heap may be suitable for simplicity and insert performance. However, for read-heavy workloads or queries that require efficient data retrieval, filtering, or sorting, a clustered index is generally a better choice as it provides a defined order for data rows, which can significantly enhance query performance.

## SQL Join Efficiency
In SQL, the efficiency of joining tables depends on several factors, including the size of the tables, the available indexes, and the specific database system being used. Generally, the efficiency of joining tables can be summarized as follows:

1. **Small with Large**: Joining a small table with a large table is often more efficient. The smaller table is scanned entirely, and then lookups are performed in the larger table. This is efficient because the smaller table can fit in memory, reducing the need for disk I/O operations.
2. **Large with Small**: Joining a large table with a small table can be less efficient, especially if the small table is not properly indexed. The database may need to scan the large table, which can be resource-intensive.
3. **Large with Large**: Joining two large tables can be resource-intensive, especially if neither table is adequately indexed. This can lead to substantial disk I/O and can be slower compared to joining a small table with a large one.

To improve the efficiency of joins, consider the following best practices:
- **Indexing**: Indexes on columns used in join conditions can significantly speed up the join process. Make sure to index columns commonly used in joins, especially in large tables.
- **Statistics**: Keep statistics updated for the database optimizer to make informed decisions about query execution plans.
- **Partitioning**: If your database system supports partitioning, it can help with performance when joining large tables by reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned.
- **Optimize Queries**: Write efficient SQL queries. Ensure that your join conditions are selective and minimize unnecessary joins.
- **Caching**: Utilize caching mechanisms if available to reduce the need for repeated disk reads.

Ultimately, the most efficient way to join tables depends on the specific use case, the database system, and the available resources. Profiling and benchmarking different join strategies in your specific environment is often the best way to determine the optimal approach for your queries.
Indexing improves the performance of database queries by enabling the database management system (DBMS) to quickly locate and retrieve specific rows from a table. Here's how indexing accomplishes this and why it's beneficial for query performance:

1. **Faster Data Retrieval**: When you query a table without an index, the DBMS must scan the entire table to find the rows that match your query criteria. This can be slow, especially for large tables. With an index, the DBMS can use the index's structure to quickly pinpoint the relevant rows, reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned.
2. **Reduced Disk I/O**: Without an index, reading large portions of the table from disk is necessary for each query, leading to high disk I/O and slower performance. Indexes provide a more compact structure that reduces the amount of data that needs to be read from disk.
3. **Ordering and Sorting**: Indexes can also be used to efficiently order and sort data. This is especially useful for queries that involve ordering by a specific column or performing aggregate operations.
4. **Support for Joins**: Indexes on join columns can significantly speed up join operations between multiple tables. They allow the DBMS to quickly identify matching rows in both tables, improving query performance.
5. **Constraint Enforcement**: Indexes can enforce uniqueness constraints, ensuring that values in a column are unique. This constraint is efficiently checked using an index, preventing the insertion of duplicate data.
6. **Query Plan Optimization**: The query optimizer in the DBMS uses index statistics to choose the most efficient execution plan for a query. It considers factors such as index selectivity and cardinality to determine the optimal path for accessing data.

However, it's important to note that while indexing can greatly enhance query performance, it's not without trade-offs:
- **Storage Overhead**: Indexes consume additional storage space. This is a trade-off between storage and query performance. More indexes mean faster queries but larger storage requirements.
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Indexes need to be maintained as data is inserted, updated, or deleted from the table. This can introduce overhead during data modification operations.
- **Choice of Index**: It's crucial to choose the right columns to index. Indexing too many columns or indexing columns that are rarely used in queries can lead to unnecessary overhead.
- 
## Temp Tables
There are two varieties of temp tables. Local temp tables are only accessible from their creation context, such as the connection. Global temp tables are accessible from other connection contexts. Both local and global temp tables reside in the tempdb database.

**Creating Global Temporary Tables (##GlobalTempTable):**
- Global temporary tables are visible to all sessions (users) and are deleted when the last session referencing them is closed.
- They are useful for sharing temporary data across different sessions.

**Syntax to Create a Global Temporary Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE ##GlobalTempTable (
    Column1 datatype,
    Column2 datatype,
    -- Define other columns and constraints as needed
);
```

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE ##GlobalTempTable (
    EmployeeID INT,
    EmployeeName NVARCHAR(50),
    -- Additional columns
);
```

**Creating Local Temporary Tables (#LocalTempTable):**
- Local temporary tables are visible only within the current session and are deleted when the session is closed.
- They are useful for temporary data storage within a single session.

**Syntax to Create a Local Temporary Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE #LocalTempTable (
    Column1 datatype,
    Column2 datatype,
    -- Define other columns and constraints as needed
);
```

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE #LocalTempTable (
    ProductID INT,
    ProductName NVARCHAR(100),
    -- Additional columns
);
```

**Key Points:**
- Temporary tables are often used for intermediate data storage during complex queries or data transformations.
- Temporary tables are automatically dropped when they go out of scope (e.g., when the session or sessions using them are closed).
- Ensure that the column datatypes and constraints match your specific requirements.
- Temporary tables can be used to store, manipulate, and join data just like regular tables.
- To access global temporary tables from different sessions, use the double pound sign (##) before the table name. For local temporary tables within the same session, use a single pound sign (#).

**Note:** Be cautious when using temporary tables, especially global ones, as they can potentially lead to resource contention in multi-user environments. Always drop them when they are no longer needed to free up resources.

## Indexing
In summary, indexing is a valuable tool for optimizing database query performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned and enabling efficient data retrieval. However, it should be used judiciously, with careful consideration of the specific database workload and query patterns.
Point 1 refers to the fact that indexing allows for faster data retrieval by enabling the database management system (DBMS) to quickly locate and retrieve specific rows from a table. Let's break down how this works in more detail:

1. **Index Structure**: An index is a data structure that the DBMS creates alongside a table. It contains a subset of the table's columns, along with references to the corresponding rows in the table.
2. **Index Key**: Each entry in the index contains a value (or a combination of values) from one or more columns of the table, known as the index key. This value is typically sorted in a specific order, either ascending or descending.
3. **Fast Lookup**: When you perform a query that includes conditions on the indexed columns, the DBMS can leverage the index to quickly locate the rows that match your query criteria. Here's how it works:
   - Suppose you have a table with an index on a "LastName" column, and you want to retrieve all rows where the last name is "Smith."
   - Instead of scanning the entire table, the DBMS consults the index, which is sorted alphabetically by last name.
   - It performs a binary search or uses other efficient search algorithms to locate the "Smith" entry in the index.
   - Once it finds the "Smith" entry in the index, it retrieves the references (pointers) to the corresponding rows in the table.
   - With these references, it can quickly access and retrieve the specific rows from the table that match the query condition.

4. **Reduced Scanning**: By using the index to locate matching rows, the DBMS significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be scanned. Without an index, the DBMS would have to scan the entire table, row by row, to find the desired records, which can be time-consuming for large tables.
5. **Ordering**: Indexes also help with ordering and sorting. If you query the same "LastName" column with an ORDER BY clause, the DBMS can use the index's sorted order to efficiently retrieve rows in the desired order.

In summary, indexing works by creating a structured data representation that allows the DBMS to quickly pinpoint specific rows in a table based on the values in the indexed columns. This greatly accelerates data retrieval, reduces disk I/O, and improves query performance, especially when dealing with large datasets. However, choosing the right columns to index and maintaining indexes properly are crucial for optimal performance.

1. **Scalar Value Function**:

   - Returns a single scalar (single value) as its output.
   - Typically used for operations that involve a single value calculation.
   - Useful for tasks like performing calculations on individual rows or returning a single result based on input parameters.
   - Example: A scalar function that calculates the square root of a number and returns a single numeric value.

2. **Table Value Function**:

   - Returns a table or set of rows as its output.
   - Can return multiple rows and columns.
   - Useful for tasks that require returning a result set or a subset of a table based on certain conditions.
   - Often used in scenarios where you need to query a set of data based on parameters and return a dynamic result.
   - Example: A table value function that takes a date range as input and returns a table of sales transactions within that range.

In summary, the main distinction lies in the output:

- Scalar functions return single values.
- Table value functions return tables or result sets with multiple rows and columns.

Certainly! Here are examples of both scalar and table value functions in SQL:

**Scalar Value Function:**

```sql
-- Scalar function that calculates the square of a number
CREATE FUNCTION CalculateSquare (@inputNumber INT)
RETURNS INT
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @result INT
    SET @result = @inputNumber * @inputNumber
    RETURN @result
END

-- Usage of the scalar function
SELECT dbo.CalculateSquare(5) AS Result; -- Returns 25
```

In this example, the `CalculateSquare` function takes an integer input and returns a single integer value, which is the square of the input.

**Table Value Function:**

```sql
-- Table value function that returns a table of employees in a specific department
CREATE FUNCTION GetEmployeesInDepartment (@departmentID INT)
RETURNS TABLE
AS
RETURN
(
    SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
    FROM Employees
    WHERE DepartmentID = @departmentID
)

-- Usage of the table value function
SELECT *
FROM dbo.GetEmployeesInDepartment(2); -- Returns a table of employees in department 2
```

In this example, the `GetEmployeesInDepartment` function takes a department ID as input and returns a table of employees who belong to that department. The result is a set of rows and columns, not just a single value.

These examples illustrate the difference between scalar and table value functions in SQL. The scalar function returns a single value, while the table value function returns a table or result set.

`CROSS APPLY` and `OUTER APPLY` are two SQL operators used to apply a table-valued function to each row of a result set. They are commonly used in SQL queries to perform operations that involve joining a table with the result of a function for each row. Here's an explanation of both with examples:

**CROSS APPLY**:

- `CROSS APPLY` is used to apply a table-valued function to each row of a table expression.
- It returns only the rows for which the function produces a result.
- It acts like an inner join, meaning that it filters out rows where the function doesn't return any values.

Example:

Suppose you have a table of employees and a table-valued function `GetEmployeeProjects` that returns a list of projects for each employee.

```sql
-- Using CROSS APPLY to get employee projects
SELECT e.EmployeeName, p.ProjectName
FROM Employees e
CROSS APPLY GetEmployeeProjects(e.EmployeeID) p;
```

In this example, `CROSS APPLY` applies the `GetEmployeeProjects` function to each employee, and it only returns employees who have associated projects. It acts like an inner join between employees and their projects.

**OUTER APPLY**:

- `OUTER APPLY` is similar to `CROSS APPLY`, but it returns all rows from the left table expression (even if the function doesn't produce any results).
- It includes rows with no function result, filling in missing values with NULLs.

Example:

Using the same tables and function as in the previous example:

```sql
-- Using OUTER APPLY to get employee projects
SELECT e.EmployeeName, p.ProjectName
FROM Employees e
OUTER APPLY GetEmployeeProjects(e.EmployeeID) p;
```

In this example, `OUTER APPLY` also applies the `GetEmployeeProjects` function to each employee. However, it returns all employees, including those without associated projects. Rows with no function result will have NULL values in the `ProjectName` column.

In summary:

- `CROSS APPLY` filters out rows where the function produces no result, acting like an inner join.
- `OUTER APPLY` includes all rows from the left table expression, filling in missing values with NULLs for rows where the function doesn't return any result.

**KEYS**:

A surrogate key is a unique identifier or key used in a database to uniquely identify each record in a table. Unlike natural keys, which are based on attributes inherent to the data, surrogate keys are typically system-generated and have no meaningful relationship to the data they identify. They are primarily used for the following reasons:

1. **Uniqueness**: Surrogate keys guarantee the uniqueness of each record within a table, even if there are no suitable natural keys. This prevents data duplication and ensures data integrity.

2. **Performance**: Surrogate keys are often integer or numeric values, which are more efficient for indexing and searching compared to composite or non-numeric natural keys.

3. **Data Changes**: Natural keys may change over time, but surrogate keys remain constant, making them stable references.

4. **Simplicity**: Surrogate keys simplify the design and maintenance of database tables, as they remove the complexity of dealing with potentially complex natural keys.

Common examples of surrogate keys include auto-incrementing integers, globally unique identifiers (GUIDs or UUIDs), and sequences generated by the database management system.

In summary, a surrogate key is an artificial, system-generated key used to uniquely identify records in a database table, providing simplicity, stability, and efficiency in database design and operations.

A **surrogate key** is a unique identifier or key used to uniquely identify each record in a table. As mentioned earlier, it is typically system-generated and has no inherent meaning or relationship to the data it identifies. Surrogate keys are used to ensure uniqueness and simplify database design.

A **primary key**, on the other hand, is a specific type of key within a database table. It is a column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in the table and enforces entity integrity, which means that each row must have a unique primary key value. While a primary key can be based on natural keys (attributes that are meaningful and inherent to the data), it can also be based on surrogate keys.

In many cases, databases use surrogate keys as primary keys because of their simplicity and efficiency. However, primary keys can also be based on natural keys if suitable ones exist in the data.

So, while a surrogate key can be used as a primary key, they are not the same thing. The primary key is a specific constraint in a table, ensuring uniqueness and integrity, while the surrogate key is the actual unique identifier used for those purposes.

Here's an example of how you could create a parent table with a primary key and a child table with a foreign key in SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE parent_table (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE child_table (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    parent_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (parent_id) REFERENCES parent_table(id)
);
```

**CROSS APPLY:**

- **Definition:** CROSS APPLY is a SQL operator used to invoke a table-valued function for each row returned by the outer table expression. It is particularly useful when dealing with functions that depend on the values of each row.

- However, it can be used with a table, not a function. When used with a table, `CROSS APPLY` works like an `INNER JOIN`, but it also allows referencing items in the left table from the right table.

- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  SELECT columns
  FROM outer_table
  CROSS APPLY table_valued_function(parameters) AS alias
  ```

- **Use Case:** Typically used when you need to apply a function to a set of data for each row individually, and the function returns a table (table-valued function).

- **Example in Your Query:**
  ```sql
  SELECT
      *
  FROM
      OPENROWSET(
        'CosmosDB',
        'Account=synapselink-cosmosdb-sqlsample;Databse=Cord19;Key=dummy
      ) WITH ( title varchar(1000) '$.metadata.title',
               authors varchar(max) '$.metadata.authors' ) AS docs
      CROSS APPLY OPENJSON ( authors )
                  WITH (
                       first varchar(50),
                       last varchar(50),
                       affiliation nvarchar(max) as json
                  ) AS x
  ```

- **Explanation:** In this query, CROSS APPLY is used to apply the OPENJSON function to each row of the 'authors' column, extracting information about each author. The result is a set of rows where the JSON array of authors is broken down into individual rows, facilitating the extraction of specific attributes like 'first', 'last', and 'affiliation' for each author.

- **Key Point:** CROSS APPLY is particularly useful when dealing with nested or hierarchical data within a row, enabling a more structured handling of individual elements in a set.

```sql
-- If you don't specify anything inside the WITH clause of CROSS APPLY OPENJSON,
-- it attempts to infer the structure of the JSON data and generates columns accordingly.

-- Example query:
SELECT
    *
FROM
    OPENROWSET(
        'CosmosDB',
        'Account=synapselink-cosmosdb-sqlsample;Database=covid;Key=YourCosmosDBKey',
        Cord19
    ) WITH (
        title varchar(1000) '$.metadata.title',
        authors varchar(max) '$.metadata.authors'
    ) AS docs
CROSS APPLY OPENJSON(authors)
```

In this query, if you don't specify columns inside the `WITH` clause of `OPENJSON(authors)`, it will try to automatically infer the JSON structure and create columns like 'key', 'value', and 'type' by default. This is convenient for simple JSON structures, but for more complex cases, it's advisable to explicitly define the columns for accurate extraction.

**Implementing Row-Level Security (RLS) in SQL Server:**

1. **Create a Table-Valued Function (TVF)**: This function will return a table that determines whether a user has access to a row based on their role or other attributes.

    ```sql
    CREATE FUNCTION securitytesting.tvf_securitypredicate_bdx_binder_year_of_account(@yearofaccount AS INT)  
        RETURNS TABLE  
    WITH SCHEMABINDING  
    AS  
        RETURN SELECT 1 AS tvf_securitypredicate_result
                 FROM securitytesting.bdx_binder_year_of_account yoa
                WHERE IS_MEMBER(yoa.external_group) = 1
                  AND yoa.YearOfAccount = @yearofaccount
                UNION ALL
                SELECT 1 AS tvf_securitypredicate_result
                 WHERE IS_ROLEMEMBER('db_owner') = 1
    GO
    ```

2. **Create a Security Policy**: Use the `CREATE SECURITY POLICY` statement to apply the TVF as a filter predicate to a table.

    ```sql
    CREATE SECURITY POLICY securitytesting.SecurityPolicy
    ADD FILTER PREDICATE securitytesting.tvf_securitypredicate_bdx_binder_year_of_account(YearOfAccount)
    ON securitytesting.bdx_binder_year_of_account
    WITH (STATE = ON);
    ```

**Implementing Column-Level Security with Dynamic Data Masking (DDM) in SQL Server:**

1. **Add a Mask to a Column**: Use the `ALTER TABLE` statement to add a mask to a column.

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE securitytesting.bdx_binder_year_of_account
    ADD MASKED WITH (FUNCTION = 'default()')
    FOR [SensitiveColumn];
    ```

2. **Grant the `UNMASK` Permission**: Use the `GRANT` statement to give specific users or roles the ability to see the unmasked data.

    ```sql
    GRANT UNMASK TO [SpecificUserOrRole];
    ```

With these steps, you can implement row-level and column-level security in SQL Server to control access to data based on the user's identity or role.
